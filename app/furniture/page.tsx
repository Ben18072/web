        <p>
These are the Terms and Conditions of Benjamin Griebeler, acting as an individual app developer, operating under the business name Ljusdal (hereinafter referred to as “LJUSDAL”, “we”, or “us”).

Our Apps are made available through third-party platforms such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, or other similar marketplaces (each an “App Store”, collectively the “App Stores”). Please note that your relationship with the respective App Store is governed by that App Store’s own terms of use; these Terms do not apply to that relationship.

You must have reached a minimum age to purchase paid features (see below) in our Apps. By purchasing a paid feature, you confirm that you have reached the minimum age of the country in which you reside.
